# .NET Generics Template
This repository provides a modular and extensible template for building C# ASP.NET Core Web APIs using generics and clean architecture principles. It includes pre-built implementations of generic interfaces, services, controllers, search objects, paging, and mapping â€” enabling rapid API development with minimal boilerplate.

In addition, the template comes with basic authentication already implemented, allowing secure access control and user identity management out of the box.
